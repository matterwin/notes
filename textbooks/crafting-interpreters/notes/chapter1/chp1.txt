# Chapter 1

- self-hosting: 
You can craft any compiler in any language for any language, including itself -- called a "self-hosting" 

- bootstrapping:
Create a compiler to compile a new language. Craft a compiler of that new language using the 1st created compiler.
Now, you can throw away the old compiler, and now use the newly made compiler of that new language to compile futureversions of itself.

- book is broken down in 2 interpreters:
jlox, in java, focus is concepts.
clox, in C, focus is detailed implementations.
